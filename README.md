# How to contribute (for developers)

The open nature of CloMet intrinsically relies on the developers community to extend and maintain it (as it is already being done with other tools in the field, see  https://github.com/topics/metabolomics). The software has been designed in such a modular way meeting the Object Oriented Programming standards to facilitate the extension of its capabilities. To further ease this task, we have released the class diagram of the software, so developers can go directly to those modules that they want to improve/extend.
